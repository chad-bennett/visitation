			<p>Not only did this class give me the chance to find my own way but, it was taught in a
				way that I was safe to express myself and grow exponentially as an artist. I was
				challenged and uplifted daily! I learned more about myself, artistic expression,
				computer graphics, and design in this one class than I did in the entirety of all my
				college courses combined. Working with Chad changed my life and I am forever
				grateful! Thank you! 10/10 would do again!<span>Meg Evert</span></p>

			<p>Hi Mr.Chad. I would like to say thanks for all the things you taught me last year in
				our class. I used those skills to land a Graphic Designer/ Web designer job and now
				spend half of my
				day having fun and doing what I like to do. I appreciate all you taught to me and I
				wish the class had a second year program.<br><span>Colden Love</span></p>

			<p>Digital Media and design not only helped me grow my technical digital art skills but
				it also helped me grow creatively as well. Such a welcoming environment. An
				environment where you can come in, unpack all your personal problems and enjoy the
				company of others around you. I can say that without that class I wouldn't be on the
				same creative or artistic trajectory im on right now. The assignments really teach
				you by letting you take your own experience and apply it. Never once did i feel like
				i was getting the short end of the stick creatively when doing an assignment, if
				anything the assignments encourage creativity and stepping outside what you may be
				used too. On top of that, the skills that you learn in this class are invaluable in
				that, you aren't doing something like chasing an art degree that wont fetch you
				anything in the real world. You're learning real design skills that you can apply to
				your potential career in graphic design. A career path that is in high demand. The
				way i saw it, the teacher points you in a direction and lets you walk your own path
				wherever that may be. <br><span>Oz Thompson</span></p>

			<p>I use what you taught me in manufacturing all the time. How to make data pop / words,
				phrasing, etc. conveying a message quickly and accurately. Without distracting them
				with unnecessary information. For quick diagrams to use to instruct employees. As
				well as writing Emails believe it or not. When to bold text or underline text,
				etc<br><span>Paul Irish</span></p>

			<p>Chad Bennett Is a very kind, caring, and smart individual. Chad helps his students

			<p>Mr. Chad is my favorite teacher at the moment, and is the best teacher I have had in

				the work for them.<span>Random Student</span></p>

			<p>I've had other teachers teach similar subjects, but their inability to teach it
				discouraged me from wanting to learn about digital media and design, but Mr. Chad
				somehow teaches it much more effectively; in a way that I don't feel pressured and
				learn to hate the subject but rather learn about the course and the skills it
				involves, meanwhile enjoying the process of learning.<span>Another Student</span>

			<p>Having Chad as an instructor throughout my senior year of high school was a fantastic
				learning experience. He pushed us to be creative and solve problems by ourselves,
				but was always available to help one-on-one as well. Taking a web design class with
				Chad introduced me to the world of HTML and CSS, and actually led me to my current
				job as an intern for the LCC Open Learning Lab. The web design knowledge and
				experience I gained from Chad’s class helped me to get this job, and I continue to
				use what he taught me while creating websites. Chad is rare in the sense that he
				genuinely cares about his students and his teaching, and I’m thankful that I had the
				opportunity to learn from such a kind and talented individual. <span>Nathan

			<p>Chad was one of the best teachers I've had. His web design class helped kickstart my
				love for development and proper design. I am currently a business systems developer
				and look back fondly at the times spent in his class as well as use those teaching
				to help me in my career. He encourages creativity and putting a piece of yourself
				into everything you do. His positive attitude and strive for his students to succeed
				is something that should be rewarded and used as an example for other

			<p>Mr. Bennett was a great teacher when I had him for Digital
				Media and Design through Eaton RESA. He would always give students a challenge that
				they
				could creatively overcome, and for those who finished early he would even help one
				on
				one so that they could test things that they might want to follow in the future.
				Whenever students did not understand what had to be done in a lesson he would
				explain in
				another way to help them put the pieces together and figure out how the lesson was
				to be
				completed.<span>Kynan Morrreti</span></p>
